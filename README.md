# Simple Task Management System

This is a simple task management system built using Python. It utilizes various data structures such as Linked Lists (both Circular and Doubly), a Queue, and a Stack to manage tasks.

## Features

1. **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks and add them to the system.
2. **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be assigned different priorities, allowing the system to manage them accordingly.
3. **Task Scheduling**: Tasks can be scheduled to be completed at a specific time or within a certain timeframe.
4. **Task Tracking**: The system keeps track of the status of each task, allowing users to monitor their progress.
5. **Task Filtering and Sorting**: Users can filter and sort tasks based on various criteria, such as priority, due date, or status.
6. **Task Delegation**: Tasks can be assigned to different users, enabling team collaboration.
7. **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for upcoming tasks, overdue tasks, and task updates.

## Data Structures Used

1. **Linked List (Circular and Doubly)**: The tasks are stored in a Linked List, with both Circular and Doubly Linked List implementations. This allows for efficient task management, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
2. **Queue**: A Queue is used to manage the order of tasks, ensuring that high-priority tasks are processed first.
3. **Stack**: A Stack is used to keep track of completed tasks, allowing users to easily review their progress and undo/redo actions if necessary.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. **Usage**: Run the main script to start the task management system.

```
git clone https://github.com/tebogoyungmercykay/simple-task-management.git
cd simple-task-management
make clean && make
make run
```
